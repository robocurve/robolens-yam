# robolens-yam — agent guide

RoboInspect adapters that let evals (e.g. [KitchenBench](https://github.com/robocurve/kitchenbench))
run on real **I2RT YAM bimanual arms** driven by **MolmoAct2**. This is a
**plugin package** in the RoboInspect ecosystem — the framework lives in
[roboinspect](https://github.com/robocurve/roboinspect); benchmarks are separate repos
indexed by [WorldEvals](https://github.com/robocurve/worldevals).

## The one big idea

RoboInspect evals swap two inputs: a `Policy` (VLA brain) and an `Embodiment` (robot
body + world). We ship both for one real stack:

- **`molmoact2` policy** — a thin HTTP client for MolmoAct2's first-party
  bimanual-YAM `/act` server. The model runs in its own process (GPU + weights);
  we never import torch here.
- **`yam_arms` embodiment** — the i2rt joint-position driver.

Both declare the **same 14-D `joint_pos` contract** (2 arms × [6 joints +
gripper], cameras `top/left/right`, packed `joint_pos` state). That makes
`roboinspect.compat.check_compatibility` pass with zero errors **and** zero warnings
— the property `tests/test_compat.py` locks down.

## Layout

- `src/robolens_yam/` — the package (see `src/robolens_yam/CLAUDE.md`).
- `tests/` — pytest; everything (driver, cameras, `/act`, clock, operator stdin)
  is injected, so the suite needs **no hardware, no server, no stdin**.
- `plans/0001-yam-molmoact2-design.md` — the design + plan (approved after two
  adversarial subagent critique rounds). Read it before changing the contract.

## Working here

- Dev loop: `uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`, `uv run pre-commit install`,
  then `uv run pytest --cov`.
- **Local install gotcha:** `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"` resolves roboinspect +
  kitchenbench from git tags. To work against sibling checkouts instead:
  `uv pip install -e ../roboinspect && uv pip install --no-deps -e ../kitchenbench`
  (the `--no-deps` avoids a roboinspect URL conflict with kitchenbench's own
  `tool.uv.sources`).
- Gates (all blocking in CI): `ruff check .`, `ruff format --check .`,
  `mypy` (strict), `pytest --cov` at **100%**.
- **mypy + numpy:** numpy 2.5's stubs use 3.12-only syntax that mypy (py3.10
  target) rejects; the dev extra pins `numpy<2.5` and CI runs mypy on 3.11.
- **No torch.** The model lives in the MolmoAct2 server. Hardware/client deps
  (`requests`, `json_numpy`, `i2rt`) are optional extras, lazily imported behind
  `# pragma: no cover` seams; the `import-hygiene` CI job enforces that
  `import robolens_yam` works with only roboinspect + numpy.

## Safety invariants (do not weaken)

- `YAMEmbodiment.step()` **always clamps** to `YamConfig.joint_low/high` before
  commanding, independent of any `Approver`. This is the last line of defense.
- The declared `control_mode` is `joint_pos` (absolute). Delta checkpoints are
  converted to absolute *inside* `step()` (`joints_are_delta=True`) so the
  declared semantics stay honest. There is no `joint_delta` control mode in
  RoboInspect, so compat cannot verify abs-vs-delta — that's a hardware check.
- Success reaches the scorer **only** via `StepResult.termination_reason="success"`
  (stock `rollout` never sets `operator_judgement`).

## Out of scope

Launching/serving MolmoAct2 (that's the `allenai/molmoact2` repo), single-arm or
non-YAM I2RT robots, and model fine-tuning.
